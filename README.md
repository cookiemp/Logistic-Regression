# Logistic Regression from Scratch

## Course: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence  

## Institution: Addis Ababa University  



## Description

This repository contains a manual implementation of Logistic Regression for binary classification using Python and NumPy. It avoids high-level ML libraries to demonstrate the underlying mathematics of the Sigmoid activation function and Cross-Entropy Loss.



## Files

 `main.py`: The source code containing the algorithm, synthetic data generation, and plotting logic.

 `loss\_graph.png`: The visualization of the training loss over iterations.



## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash

&nbsp;  pip install numpy matplotlib
```
